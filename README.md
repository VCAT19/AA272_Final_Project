# AA272_Final_Project
Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) Design and Implementation for Vehicles entering GPS Deprived Environments  

Two main scripts were written for this project, one to generate a dataset and one to process the data through an EKF. The first script solves the Newton-Raphson GPS algorithm on a GNSS data log that was collected using an android smart phone and then overlays this solution with POZYX data that was available online from IEEE dataport. The script aligns the both the time and coordinate frames of the two datasets to create one continuous trajectory dataset in a .mat file. This first script is called Load_And_Generate_Data_Set.m 

The second script loads this data and implements the EKF from the Design section. It then compares the ground truth trajectory to the trajectory generated by the EKF state estimation. It allows the user to select any of the Q and R matrices from the Design section.This second script is called EKF_Implementation.m.
